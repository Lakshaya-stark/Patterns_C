Here is my very first project that is being added in my github.
# PATTERNS IN C

# DESCRIPTION:
    It is my very first project which is simply just some patterns that I learnt to print Using C language.
    This project gives you a simple Menu based consol application from which you can choose the type of pattern to print.

    This project allowed me to get a nice understanding of how loops, conditions, etc works to be used as a matrix representation.

    Please feel free to try this project little fun as a user but great in start to develop the mind as a programmer.
